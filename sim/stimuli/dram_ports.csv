# DRAM Test Stimuli - CSV Format
# Format: rst,addr,wdata,write_enable,expected_rdata
# Note: Reset is handled by testbench initialization. All test cases assume reset is released.
# Data written is often unique for easier debugging.

# Test 1: Initial state check - Read from a few addresses (should be 0 after reset)
0,0,0,0,0
0,1,0,0,0
0,15,0,0,0

# Test 2: Write to address 1 (data 0xAA), expect 0xAA
0,1,170,1,170
# Test 3: Read address 1 (should be 0xAA)
0,1,0,0,170

# Test 4: Write to address 2 (data 0x55), expect 0x55
0,2,85,1,85
# Test 5: Read address 2 (should be 0x55)
0,2,0,0,85

# Test 6: Write to address 15 (data 0xFF), expect 0xFF
0,15,255,1,255
# Test 7: Read address 15 (should be 0xFF)
0,15,0,0,255

# Test 8: Overwrite address 1 (data 0x11), expect 0x11
0,1,17,1,17
# Test 9: Read address 1 (should be 0x11)

# Test 11: Write to address 3 (data 0x33), expect 0x33
0,3,51,1,51
# Test 12: Read address 3 (should be 0x33)
0,3,0,0,51

# Test 13: Write to address 7 (data 0x77), expect 0x77
