# GPRF Test Stimuli - CSV Format
# Format: rst,address_A,address_B,address_W,write_data,write_enable,expected_reg_A,expected_reg_B
# Note: Reset is handled by testbench initialization, all test cases assume reset is released

# Test 1: Read from registers 0 and 1 (both should be 0 initially) - NO WRITE
0,0,1,1,305419896,0,0,0

# Test 2: Write to register 1 - after write, reg 1 will contain new value immediately
0,0,1,1,305419896,1,0,305419896

# Test 3: Read from register 1 (should contain written data from previous cycle)
0,0,1,2,999999999,0,0,305419896

# Test 4: Write to register 2 - after write, reg 2 will contain new value immediately
0,1,2,2,2864434397,1,305419896,2864434397

# Test 5: Read both registers after write to reg 2 in previous cycle
0,1,2,3,123456789,0,305419896,2864434397

# Test 6: Test writing to register 0 (should be ignored) - reg 0 stays 0, reg 2 unchanged
0,0,2,0,4294967295,1,0,2864434397

# Test 7: Verify reg 0 is still zero (write ignored), reg 1 unchanged
0,0,1,5,987654321,0,0,305419896

# Test 8: Read reg 31 (should be 0) and reg 1 before writing to reg 31

# Test 9: Write to register 31 - after write, reg 31 will contain new value immediately

# Test 10: Read reg 31 after write (should have data from previous write), reg 2 unchanged

# Test 11: Write to register 5 - after write, reg 5 will contain new value immediately
